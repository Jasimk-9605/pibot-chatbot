# PiBot Chatbot

A configurable chatbot project (PiBot) for building conversational assistants. This README provides a clear, actionable guide to get the project running locally, configure environment variables, run tests, build Docker images, and contribute.

> Note: This is a general, ready-to-use README template. If you want the file tailored to the exact tech stack and commands in this repository, tell me whether the project is Node.js, Python, or another stack (or let me fetch the repo) and I will customize and push the README for you.


## About

PiBot Chatbot is a conversational assistant framework that can be extended to support integrations with LLMs, messaging platforms (Telegram, Slack, Discord), or custom frontends. It is organized to separate core bot logic, connectors, and skill modules so you can iterate quickly.

## Features

- Modular architecture for connectors (chat platforms) and skills (intents/actions)
- Environment-driven configuration
- Support for one or more LLM backends (e.g., OpenAI, local LLMs)
- Example skill and conversation flows
- Docker-friendly for easy deployment
- 
## Configuration

Create a `.env` file at the project root. Example variables:

```
# .env (example)
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# LLM provider
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
LLM_PROVIDER=openai

Make sure to add `.env` to `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets.

## Running locally

Node.js example:

```bash
# development
npm run dev

# production
npm run build
npm run start
```

Python (FastAPI) example:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port ${PORT:-8000}
```

Visit http://localhost:PORT or connect your chat platform as configured.



## Usage

- Use the provided connectors to link to chat platforms (e.g., Telegram, Discord).
- Create skills or intents in the skills/ directory and register them in the main bot bootstrapper.
- Commands or conversation examples:
  - /help — list available commands
  - /chat — start a chat session (depends on implementation)

Add documentation for the specific commands or APIs that your bot exposes.

## Testing

Node.js (example):

```bash
npm test
```

Python (example):

```bash
pytest
```

Add unit and integration tests for skills and connectors.
